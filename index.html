    <p><strong>Master of Laws, Georgetown Law | John H. Jackson Trade Scholar | International Economic Policy | Legal &amp; Public Policy Analyst</strong></p>
    <p>
      I'm Preethi Gowda, a Legal and Policy Analyst deeply engaged in the evolving landscape of international trade law, sustainable development, and international economic law and policy. With a Master of Laws in International Business and Economic Law from Georgetown University, I bridge academic rigor with real-world impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work spans legal analysis, cross-border compliance, cross-sector compliance delivery, and regulatory strategy, specifically within healthcare, technology, and investment environments. Currently at MediBlock, I developed a physician identity governance system that enhanced compliance efficiency by 35% and reduced institutional risk. At Georgetown’s Center on Inclusive Trade &amp; Development, I led six major research initiatives focused on equitable and inclusive trade policy in emerging economies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond institutional work, I have authored over 50 legal and policy briefs and published op-eds in leading outlets like The Times of India, tackling issues from trade justice to climate law. My research has informed both multilateral discussions and grassroots movements, with a goal of making law and policy tools for inclusive, sustainable progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bring a solutions-driven mindset, a passion for clarity in complexity, and a firm belief in the power of law and economic empowerment to shape a better global future.
